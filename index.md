## You were sent on a reconnaissance mission to see if humans could colonize the planet HD 011235 b. Your crew left the planet with one less person than they had when they had arrived.

And getting back home will be a challenge. While the air is fully breathable, there are hostile extraterrestrials roaming the planet. It is, however, possible. Will you be able to do it? Will you find your way back home?

_Or will you be_ __STRANDED__ _forevermore?_
